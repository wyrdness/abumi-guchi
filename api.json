      "full": "Abumi-guchi is a peculiar yokai from Japanese folklore, appearing as a possessed stirrup (abumi) with a distinctive furry or shaggy appearance and a mouth capable of speech. Unlike typical tsukumogami (objects that become spirits after 100 years), Abumi-guchi is born from tragedy rather than age. The legend tells of a stirrup from a horse that died in battle alongside its samurai master. Soaked in the horse's blood and infused with the animal's loyalty, grief, and the trauma of its death, the stirrup became a sentient yokai. Despite its supernatural nature, Abumi-guchi is relatively harmless, primarily calling out to passersby or engaging in minor mischief. The yokai represents the Japanese belief that objects can absorb the emotions and experiences of traumatic events, particularly in the context of samurai warfare where the bond between warrior and mount was deeply significant. Its voice can speak, sometimes moaning or calling out, serving as a lingering reminder of the loyalty and sacrifice of war horses in feudal Japan."
